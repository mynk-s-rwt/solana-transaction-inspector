make a small minified solana app 
use react and dont use create-react-app , use vite or next 
use pnpm
use context7 MCP for solana related docs
which has functionality to connect multiple solana wallet 
once the wallet is connected there should be an big input box which can take transaction data 
if i paste the transaction data inside input box and try to click on send transaction button 
it should be able to simulate , sign and broadcast transactions 

basically https://solana.fm/inspector?cluster=mainnet-alpha this but except for just simulation being able to sign and braodact transaction with the connected solana wallet
